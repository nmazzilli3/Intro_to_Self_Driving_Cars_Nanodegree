'''
Keeping Track of Vehicle x and y¬∂
Now that you know how to solve trigonometry problems, you can keep track of a vehicle's	 ùë•	and	 ùë¶	coordinates as it moves in any direction.

The goal of this lesson is for you to implement a few methods in a Vehicle class. Once complete, your code will be used like this:

# instantiate vehicle
v = Vehicle()

# drive forward 10 meters
v.drive_forward(10)

# turn left in 10 increments of 9 degrees each.
for _ in range(10):
	v.turn(9.0)
	v.drive_forward(1)

v.drive_forward(10)

v.show_trajectory()
and this final call to show_trajectory should produce a graph that looks like this:
'''

# TODO - Complete the methods in the vehicle class. If the 
#		 requirements of any method are unclear, look at 
#		 the testing code in testing.py (you'll need to
#		 click on the "Jupyter" logo in the top left and
#		 then open testing.py)
#
#		 If you really get stuck, take a look at the 
#		 solution code in the next segment.
