Integrating Rate Gyro Data
The yaw rate of a vehicle can be measured by a rate gyro.

The yaw rate gives the rate of change of the vehicle's heading in radians per second and since a vehicle's heading is usually given by the greek letter  ùúÉ  (theta), yaw rate is given by  ùúÉÀô  (theta dot).

Integrating the yaw rate gives total change in heading.
