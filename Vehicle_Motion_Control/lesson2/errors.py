Accumulating Errors
Accelerometers are often biased. That means that even when acceleration is zero, they measure some non-zero value. Bias can be reduced through careful calibration (and buying better sensors) but it's hard to remove entirely.

In this notebook you'll briefly explore how bias tends to accumulate.
'''

'''
Part 1 - What is Bias?
A sensor is biased when it consistently reports a number that is too high or too low. Remember the elevator acceleration data?

The code below is similar to what you used to plot that data.
'''

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


# get elevator data
data = np.genfromtxt("elevator-lac.csv", delimiter=",")[100:570]

# unpack that data
t, a_x, a_y, a_z = data.T
plt.ylabel("Vertical Acceleration (m/s/s)")
plt.xlabel("Time (seconds)")
region_delimiters = [5.4, 8.9, 15.6, 18.6]
for x_val in region_delimiters:
    plt.axvline(x=x_val, color="black",linestyle='dotted')

plt.axhline(y=0, color='black',linestyle='dotted')
plt.plot(t, a_z) 
plt.show()

'''
ote how the flat parts of the graph (0 acceleration) do NOT line up with the dotted  ùëé=0  line. But they should!

This offset is due to bias in the accelerometer.

If we know there's a bias we can correct it manually.

TODO - Correct the bias

Change the second to last line of code in the code cell above to the following

plt.plot(t, a_z+0.12) 
and then re-run the cell.
